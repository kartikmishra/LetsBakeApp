# LetsBakeApp
Let's Bake app lets you choose from different recipes to make one of them.<br/>
These recipes has a detail page with all the ingredients needed and step wise instruction with the video associated with them.<br/><br/>


Some of the functionality associated with this app:-<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------

1.Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.<br/>
2.Handle error cases in Android.<br/>
3.Add a widget to your app experience.<br/>
4.Leverage a third-party library in your app.<br/>
5.Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.<br/>
6.Content Provider to store the recipes<br/>
7.Uses ButterKnife.


App Description:-<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------
This will allow a user to select<br>
a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.<br/>

The recipe listing is located here.<br/>
https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json<br/>

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images.<br/> 
Donâ€™t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.<br/>

One of the skills that will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in this <br/>
data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.<br/><br/><br/>
